He has managed to pollute a political process that we thought could not get any worse.<br/><br/>He is the Id of the Republican Party.  He congealed from the sneering hatred that Republicans had for Mr. Obama, from their disdain for his intelligence, style and grace, from his insistence on helping people who needed help and from his initiatives that treated all citizens equally, and with respect.<br/><br/>This elevated game show host has brought malignant forces into the White House that are determined to make it whiter.  His massive ego is preoccupied with perceived slights.  He is mentally unstable, inventing his own facts, lashing out at the press and ejecting crucial personnel from vital security discussions.  The emperor is not merely naked; he\u2019s dressed in a pinafore, with a lollipop for a scepter.<br/><br/>Who cares who he puts forth for the Court?  Every appointment would be guaranteed to diminish our hard-fought freedoms.<br/><br/>Freedom is just another word for something the president plans to take away from us.
