My husband and I (both Democrats) were just today discussing how any sane human could even take their child to a Catholic Church or let them even be around a priest. It is not just the scandals in recent years but the Catholic Church has a long history of preying on the innocent i.e. in Ireland, in Italy, In Spain and even in Africa. I want to ask my friends who are Catholic about this but it just seems to invasive to question their faith. One is a Republican and one is a Democrat.", "replyCount": 0, "recommendationCount": 3, "commentID": 21319852, "approveDate": "1485925988", "parentID": 21314853, "replies": [], "commentSequence": 21319852}
