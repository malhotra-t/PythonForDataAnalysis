Unfortunately it seems UNM has become much more inward-looking, much less linked to communities in the state.  There's a bitter joke here--UNM is the flagship institution of the state of NM, which means it doesn't have to do anything at all.  It's sad--wasn't like that when I was an undergrad.  On the other hand the University of Arizona is a world class school with wonderful programs for and links to rural communities.", "replyCount": 0, "recommendationCount": 0, "commentID": 21319773, "approveDate": "1485925954", "parentID": 21308331, "replies": [], "commentSequence": 21319773}
