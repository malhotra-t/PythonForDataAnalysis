I did get a lot out of Boston besides drugs and garbage. I will alwayd remember walking through the Harvard campus and experiencing amazing art and music. However, the drugs and the violence and the concrete were just to much for me. Especially the violence. I remember finding a stabbing victim outside of my apartment. I helped him, but it turned out he was a criminal and they arrested him after he got out of the ER. It turned out that he had tried to rob a drug dealer in the alley beside my flat, and the drug dealer stabbed him. <br/><br/>It was a scary place, my car was robbed at least once a month, I had to replace so many windows it was outrageous. I never experienced violence when I was growing up, and I havent since I got back. Only in Boston did I see stabbing victims bleeding in the street 10 feet from where I slept. It didnt help that the flat below me was filled with crack dealers. <br/><br/>I got nothing against city slickers, its just Id rather live in a more natural place. I do actually keep my foot in both sides though, since a lot of my friends and the activities I do are in Denver. I just cant live there, especially as a transgender woman. <br/><br/>I love your experience with minks. I didnt know they were such a pest, although I can imagine that they love chickens. They are just so cute! ", "replyCount": 0, "recommendationCount": 2, "commentID": 21319219, "approveDate": "1485926074", "parentID": 21314994, "replies": [], "commentSequence": 21319219}
