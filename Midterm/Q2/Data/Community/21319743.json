This is THE battle to pick. The Court hangs in the balance 4-4, and a relatively young Justice like Gorsuch could potentially shape the law for decades to come. There's much at stake, which is why the Republicans cynically refused to even *meet* with Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. Scalia died in February 2016, squarely within Obama's term -- this vacancy on the Court has been open for almost a year. This seat is STOLEN. Period. Democrats should refuse to consider any of Trump's nominees.", "replyCount": 0, "recommendationCount": 12, "commentID": 21319743, "approveDate": "1485926387", "parentID": 21316797, "replies": [], "commentSequence": 21319743}
