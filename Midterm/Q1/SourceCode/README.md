### Enron Email Dataset Analysis

### Foreword
Enron Corporation was a major electricity, natural gas and pulp and paper company based in Texas. It was found in 1985 and witnessed the biggest uprise in terms of innovation and revenue generated (a whopping $101 billion during 2000) until Dec 2001 when the company filed for bankruptcy after revelation of by far the biggest corporate accounting fraud, the Enron Scandal, known in the history of US. The Enron dataset consists of 500,000 emails of Enron's employees made available publicly for further investigation and analysis of the scandal.

### Target
The target of this analysis is to ascertain the role of the CEO, COO and CFO of Enron during the infamous Enron scandal and find out the people who helped them carry out this massive fraud.

### Analysis Methodology
The idea is to divide the critical timelines into 2 parts and analyse email communication patterns and their contents within these 2 parts. Also, to allow faster analysis, I'm going to focus only on the mailbox of Kenneth Lay and Jeff Skilling as they are the key persons responsible for the fraud.
- Phase 1 (year 2000): During this time Enron stocks were at its peak due to the misleading financial accounting activities promoted by Jeff Skilling, the COO.
- Phase 2 (year 2001): This is the most important phase because Jeff Skilling was promoted to CEO and he resigned within 6 months of becoming a CEO.

### Conclusion
- The change of helms of Enron from Kenneth Lay to Jeff Skilling is clearly visible by looking at their involvement in email count in each phase.
- While there was a focus on Business Development to counter the Economic Issues during first phase, but during the second phase the focus was more on financial trading of Enron stocks which hint at Insider Trading.
- Judging by the participation levels of Kenneth Lay during both phases, we can say that he was the central piece to the whole puzzle. While Jeff Skilling was primarily involved in spreading fraudulent activities outside of the US.
- Using analysis 2 and 3 we have identified certain keywords that raise some red flags. Cross verifying those keywords against mailboxes of other employees we can find out some of the other suspects who helped the top level executive in carrying out fraudulent activities.
- Also, the emails of two main people involved are missing namely Andrew Fastow (the CFO) and Sherron Watkins (the whistleblower who surrendered upon this scandal's revelation). Analysis of their emails can surely bring in some more interesting insights of this case.
